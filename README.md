The Robot Guidance Challenge involves programming the EEBot mobile robot to navigate a maze with a line-guidance system and the ability to reverse its path. Key tasks include:
Line Following: The robot starts at the maze entry and tracks the guidance line.
S-Turn Navigation: It demonstrates the guidance algorithm by navigating through S turns.
Junction Decisions: At junctions, the robot decides which branch to take.
Dead-End Handling: If it encounters a barrier, it triggers a 180Â° turn, retraces its path, and chooses an alternate branch. Incorrect branches are marked for reference.
Correct Path Memory: If no dead end is encountered, the robot records the branch as correct.
Maze Completion: The robot continues until it reaches the forward destination point, marked by the operator tapping the rear bumper.
Reverse Navigation: The robot retraces its path back to the starting point, choosing the correct branches.
